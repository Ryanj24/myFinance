## Challenges & Limitations

myFinance was easily the largest and most complex project I've completed to date taking approximately 3 months to complete and came with numerous challenges and limitations. 

<h3>MySQL</h3>
The most significant challenge was using MySQL in a project for the first time as I had to ensure the database was configured properly and that the schema was designed correctly. In addition, I also had to implement some database triggers and stored procedures which were a challenge to ensure that the correct values were being passed into the stored procedures and the procedure itself was doing the correct operations. 

<h3>React Recharts & React Hook Form</h3>
Another challenge of the project was using the React recharts and React Hook Form libraries for the frontend. The recharts library was a challenge as it involved ensuring the data was formatted correctly for the charts to display it.
In addition, customising the chart labels required extensive use of the documentation to create seperate components that were passed to the main chart components as props. 

React Hook Form provided its own challenges, most specifically when ensuring each form field was registered correctly and handling errors.

<h3>React Redux</h3>
This project was also the first project in which I've used React Redux for more complex state management. Having previously used Context API, I found react redux to be much simpler to use although still pretty challenging along with implementing the reducer functions correctly to update the state.

<h3>API Limitations</h3>
A substantial limitation of the project is the API usage for fetching the financial data for a company the user searches for. The free tiers of the <a href="https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs">Financial Modeling Prep</a> and <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/">AlphaVantage</a> APIs required 5 different requests to get data for the company overview and general information, key performance metrics such as the companys P/E ratio, company balance sheets and income statements and the historical share price performance. 
The multiple requests to different APIs thus leads to a slower performance in comparison to making fewer requests to a single API.
Moreover, the AlphaVantage API is limited to only 25 requests per day on the free tier, hence the use of the Financial Modeling Prep API to take the majority of the requests as it has a higher usage limit.
